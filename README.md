# MultiInstances

A simple tool that lets you run multiple Roblox instances at the same time on one PC.

## What it does

This tool bypasses Roblox's single-instance limitation, allowing you to:
- Run multiple Roblox instances simultaneously
- Easily switch between allowing one or multiple instances

## How to use it

1. Start the app
2. Click the toggle button or press Space to allow multiple instances
3. Launch Roblox as normal
4. Launch additional Roblox windows as needed

The status will show green when multiple instances are allowed, and red when they're blocked (normal Roblox behavior).
